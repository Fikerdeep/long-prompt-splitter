      "Introduction \n",
      "The digital humanities, also known as humanities computing, is a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It is methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form. It studies how these media affect the disciplines in which they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to our knowledge of computing [1]. Earnshaw on his paper concerning Research and Development in Digital Media points out that there is no one specific definition for Digital humanities and there is a difficulty on what precisely digital humanities work entails because of the interdisciplinary nature of the field, so different fields within the humanities define it according to their area of specialization. But on this particular paper, the author defines Digital humanities as \"Digital Humanities have been traditionally used in the context of the application of computing and information technology to the field of the humanities.”[2].\n",
      "The paper discusses the advantage of digital humanities like digitalization of texts and manuscripts, images can be scanned to further analysis, historical sites are scanned for recording and curation purposes. The other areas were digital humanities are useful include galleries and museums by digitalizing their content for it to be accessible worldwide. The major Application area of computing to the humanities discipline includes digitalization of texts and manuscripts, Algorithmic analysis of digital texts and objects, Interactive exploration of digital texts and objects, Using big data methods to analyze complex data sets such as digital media data in the humanities and using digital objects in the humanities to develop new digital technologies and new tools[1].  \n",
      "The Digital Humanities is facilitating new ways of research organization as evidenced by the crossover between humanities and computer science. The collaboration of humanities with the field of computing make up a two-way process where computing fields try to come up with methods and tools for analyzing or to deal with a new requirement of the humanities discipline. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author gave emphasis to research area related to a digital application to any discipline and humanities are the main area digitalization has made so much difference in performing an everyday activity. Research Projects and Collaboration in humanities includes humanities in the European research area which aim was to motivate research in humanity discipline and give positive attitude toward humanity for the development of European societies, DH commons that provide common platform for the digital humanity projects who need assistance and scholars interested in collaboration, Digital Research Infrastructure to support the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) aims to give a long term access and use to all of European arts and humanities in digital research, The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funds research or research project related to the humanity discipline. \n",
      "The Strength of the Paper\n",
      "The main strength of the paper was addressing the current stage of advancement in digital Humanities technology also defining the clear difference between the digital humanities and computational humanities. The author highlighted the importance of research and mainly involving the digitalization of materials in humanities. The paper also listed digital humanities projects that are available and provide detail aim of the projects. The author used easy to understand words.\n",
      "Some of the contributions of the paper are \n",
      "The author pointed out the lack of clearly stated work entitlement of digital humanity \n",
      "Offer knowledge about the available Digital Humanities  research projects in European communities  \n",
      "States how there are different government and non-government agencies which aims to fund the project in digital humanities\n",
      "Clearly, showed how the world can benefit from investing in a research project on digital humanities\n",
      "Listed some of the common platform related to matching interested participants with a researcher who seeks investment  \n",

      "Expose or inform people to different funding agencies available in digital humanities \n",
      "The weakness of the paper\n",
      "The author assessed digital humanities by addressing the current technology, advantage and research projects in digital humanities on European communities. The major weakness of the paper was \n",
      "The introduction fail to lay out a clear plan for the whole paper\n",
      "Lack of clear objective even though the language used were easy to understand, lack of the objective makes it hard to get the clear purpose of the paper. \n",
      "The paper also missed hypothesis and any argument to defend or support any idea.\n",
      "In review of the research project the author just copy and paste the aim or work of the foundation without even summarization or remarks from his perspective\n",
      "The paper only focused on research foundation based in Europe only don't cover other areas\n",
      "The paper don’t present any result or findings \n",
      "Paper missed conclusion and recommendation \n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "Digital humanities are work at the intersection of digital technology and humanities disciplines[3]. the author stated that there is a lack of clear definition for digital humanity even with this review digital humanities have three different definitions depending on the content of the paper and because digital humanities being a young discipline that doesn’t have one accepted definition. The author way of presenting how the opportunity in digital humanity research projects are growing will encourage people to participate in solving a problem that are encounter by the humanities disciplines.\n",
      "The main recommendation I will suggest is before anything else clearly defining the objective of the study should be prioritized. Instead of only focusing on the European community the paper should also include organization that fund research project in the digital humanities area. \n",
