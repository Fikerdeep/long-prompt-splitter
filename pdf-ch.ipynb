      "Report on Rossmann Pharmaceutical Sales Prediction . By: Bekalu Tadele:  bekiman21@gmail.com Business Overview The finance team of Rossmann Pharmaceutical wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgment to forecast sales. The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality  as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores. Preprocessing Before using,  the data and start exploring to make visualizat ions we need to prepare the raw data. We have three  data we will use for this preprocessing.\n",

Our goal is to check how some measures such as promos and opening of new stores affect purchasing behavior. We use the following points as a guide during your analysis.  Sales behavior before, during and after holidays We can see from the above comparison public holidays have more purchase, Christmas has the least purchase sales\n",
